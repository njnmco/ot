Description: 'Open Tracing' <https://opentracing.io> allows developers to
    add instrumentation to their application code using interfaces that are
    vendor-agnostic. This is used to monitor services, triage
    failures and find performance bottlenecks, among other things. The 'ot'
    package has generic methods to be extended when implementing the
    specification for a specific vendor.
